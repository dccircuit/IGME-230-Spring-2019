## II. Readings and Homework Assignments
As always, keep an eye on the myCourses dropboxes, both the descriptions and due dates. These will help you keep track of what is due/when, and what you should be working on.

## III. Project 2
Also remember that the proposal for Project 2 is due soon. For the proposal, submit a PDF containing the following:

- Your name and team member's name - one posting per team (a partner is optional but encouraged)
- What Web service are you using and what functionality do you want to implement?
- Project requirements are here: [project-2.md](../projects/project-2.md)
