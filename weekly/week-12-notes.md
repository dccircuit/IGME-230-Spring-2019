# More PixiJS

## I. Overview
Tuesday, we begin by looking at everyone's Project 2 prototypes.  Groups will be randomized.  See projection screen for groups.
Afterwards, we'll continue working with PixiJS ([starting here](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/pixi-js-2.md)), and build our game HW, *Circle Blast!*, in preparation for the final project.

## V. Font loading problems?
You might run into issues with PixiJS not displaying a custom font, because the JS executes faster than a font can load. Here are some potential solutions:
